# Build a Game Project: Feed-A-Star-Mole
Build a working feed-a-star-mole game from the ground up that utilizes the skills you learned in previous bootcamp courses to structure, lay out, style, and add functionality to a group of hungry moles that appear and disappear as the user tries to feed them. The exercise is broken up into an introduction to what the final product will look like, the HTML and CSS solution for the game, and then the JavaScript solution.

This course is completely free as part of the Frontend Masters Online Bootcamp!
