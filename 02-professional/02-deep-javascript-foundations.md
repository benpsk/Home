## Deep JavaScript Foundations

Dive into the core pillars of the JavaScript language with Kyle Simpson, author of the popular, You Don't Know JS, book series. You'll learn JavaScript's types, how to convert between them, and compare them with == and ===. You'll also learn lexical scope and closure. As well as the objects oriented system (this, prototypes and classes).
