## Getting Started with JavaScrip
Want to learn to code using JavaScript? This is a great place to start! In this course, you’ll start out with a tour of the basic building blocks programming like variables, loops, functions and operations. Then, you’ll go through the three main pillars of JavaScript: Types and Coercion for comparing values and converting between types, Scope and Closure for knowing where variables can be accessed, and JavaScript’s “this” and Prototype system for dynamic context.
